## Analyzing Business Patterns and Seasonality
/*
BUSINESS CONCEPT: ANALYZING SEASONALITY & BUSINESS PATTERNS
Analyzing business patterns is about generating insights to help you maximize
efficiency and anticipate future trends.

COMMON USE CASES: 1) Day-parting analysis to understand how much support staff 
				     you should have at different times of day or days of the week.
				  2) Analyzing seasonality to better prepare for upcoming spikes or 
                     slowdowns in demand.
Using DATE functions.

-- ANALYZING SEASONALITY
-- Take a look at 2012â€™s monthly and weekly volume patterns to see if we can find any 
-- seasonal trends we should plan for in 2013. Pull session volume and order volume.

-- Conclusion: From the result, it seems like ~10 sessions per hour per employee staffed is
-- 			   about right. We can plan on one support staff around the clock and then we should 
-- 			   double up to two staff members from 8am to 5pm Monday through Friday.
